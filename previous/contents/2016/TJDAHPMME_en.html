            <p class="text-justify">
                This essay re-examines the conflict and controversy between the Elizabethan exorcist John Darrell and his state church opponent Samuel Harsnett in the context of the longue durée of pre-modern practical magic in England. Darrell made his name in wider England with his exorcisms in northern England in 1596 and was imprisoned in 1599 by the High Commission as a fraud and was subsequently attacked by state church authorities in a propaganda campaign led by Samuel Harsnett, then chaplain to the powerful bishop of London Richard Bancroft. In contrast to Harsnett’s charges of arrogating religious charisma by means of histrionically manipulated exorcisms, Darrell’s stated intention was to institute fasting and prayer, his method of choice for dispossessing, as an ordinary means of Protestant miracle-making. Seen in light of the history of pre-modern practical magic, particularly in its apotropaic capacity, the ordinariness of his thaumaturgy, I argue, renders Darrell a proper Protestant successor to the practitioners of pre-Reformation magic for a population lacking technological mastery its environment.
