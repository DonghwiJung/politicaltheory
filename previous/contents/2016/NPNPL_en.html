            <p class="text-justify">Abstract:</p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Political liberalism involves a commitment to a certain kind of constraint on the justification of political institutions and laws. Very roughly, the idea is that the justification for political institutions and laws must in some sense be accessible to reasonable citizens. I suspect that this view gains some intuitive appeal from its engagement with perfectionism. My first aim in this paper is to show that the way in which political liberalism objects to perfectionism is distinct from and largely orthogonal to a more familiar, commonsense objection to paternalism that one might direct at perfectionism. So, those inclined to reject perfectionism as paternalistic can do so without thereby being committed to political liberalism.
                <br />
                Next, I aim to show that there is an interesting class of views about the justification of political institutions and laws that are neither perfectionist nor politically liberal. These views are not subject to the familiar, commonsense objection to paternalism that might be directed at perfectionism. But they still reject political liberalism’s commitment to the constraint on political justification described above. I consider two ways political liberals might motivate this commitment. First, I look at a potential motivation stemming from a view about coercion. And then I look at a potential motivation stemming from a particular conception of political communities. I argue that there are attractive alternative ways of thinking about coercion and the political community. And so I will suggest that it is worth exploring the viability of views of that are neither perfectionist nor politically liberal.
