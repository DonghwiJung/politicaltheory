            <p class="text-justify">
                What would Rawls have done to his theory of justice if he had considered the problems of climate change? In this paper, I argue that a new principle of background justice should be added to Rawls’s Law of Peoples because climate change is an international and intergenerational problem that can destabilize the Society of Peoples and the well-ordered peoples therein. More specifically, I argue that climate change poses a non-negligible or realistic threat to the stability of liberal peoples whose national economy is dependent on climate-sensitive resources and barely sufficient to sustain a just basic structure. Rawls’s own principles of justice, such as the duty of assistance and the just savings principle, do not properly prevent negative impacts of climate change from destabilizing these climate-vulnerable peoples and thus undermining international peace and security. Still, Rawls’s framework provides the theoretical resources to develop a new extension. Despite the uncertainties due to the complexity of the climate system and about the resilience of liberal societies, liberal peoples’ fundamental interests in national security and political independence calls for the adoption of a precautionary principle that guarantees the environmental background conditions of justice under which each well-ordered people can sustain their basic structure over generations. This Rawlsian principle of international, intergenerational justice implies that the total amount of global greenhouse emissions should be determined by the optimal portfolio of mitigation, adaptation, and geoengineering that protects the basic structure of well-ordered peoples from climate change into the long-term future. The emissions permits should be allocated among peoples mainly in proportion to their energy needs for the maintenance of basic institutions. The resources for adaptation are shared across nations and generations. I conclude by comparing the Rawlsian response to climate change with that of utilitarianism.
