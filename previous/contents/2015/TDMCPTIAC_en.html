            <p class="text-justify">
                What accounts for the continuing centrality of classical political thought to political theorists and democratic citizens of the 21st century? This paper first canvasses responses to this question in the writings of Leo Strauss, Bernard Williams, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Unlike historical or contextual scholars, these theorists have (whatever their differences) striven self-consciously to set classical thought and liberal modernity into a fruitful dialectical relationship. More precisely, they have brought to the surface diverse ideas and  practices submerged in the particularities of Greek life and used them as a foundation for self-understanding and self-criticism in other times and locations, including our own. Yet, in their eagerness to engage with individual elite texts, I argue, they tend to neglect politics itself, and in particular the reflections on virtue and civic education that characterized Athenian democratic discourse. Set against modernity’s forgetfulness of ethical character, the Athenians’ “virtuous politics” offers us a novel way to relate the particular (the political ideas and practices of classical antiquity) to the universal (politics as such). The Athenians’ ambitious political project can be adequately understood, though, only by exposing their politics of virtue to a critical encounter with contemporaries such as Thucydides and Plato, whose political visions remind us of the limitations and ambiguities that beset the sphere of the political altogether. By reconstructing these elements or “moments” of the classical Greek experience, I recover in classical Athens a quasi-Hegelian “Geist” that chastens modernity’s hubristic optimism and remedies its forgetfulness of human excellence.
