            <p class="text-justify">
                When agents who are committed to the idea of contribution-based responsibilities find themselves in situations in which it is unclear whether or not they have actually contributed to some harm, how should they conceive of their responsibilities? That is, what practical stance should they adopt when they are uncertain about whether or not they have contributed to some harm? This question, concerning responsibility in conditions of uncertainty, is one that needs to be engaged with by anyone who affirms such responsibilities and who wishes to act in a way that is informed by them. Moreover, this issue is of particular importance when it comes to assessing responsibilities to address global poverty, given that claims regarding contribution to poverty are typically contested, and evidence of contribution to poverty and the magnitude of such contribution will often be indecisive. We examine one approach to this question, modelled on standards employed in criminal and civil law, and reject it in favour of an alternative approach, which we call the Expectations Approach.
