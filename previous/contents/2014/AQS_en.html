               This paper aims to (re)consider the status of Quentin Skinner’s methodological approach to the study of intellectual history. The purpose of this presentation is to canvass an interesting, and I think, underexplored categorization of Skinner’s method. This paper picks up on a lively debate among some of Skinner’s supporters and opponents about whether he has prescribed a methodology typical of the social sciences or whether he recommends an heuristic germane to the arts and humanities. Following Mark Bevir, this dichotomy turns on the sense that a methodology is a necessary (if not sufficient) process for inquiry, whereas an heuristic is a potentially useful tool for gaining insight, but hardly a necessary or sufficient condition. For Bevir, and more recently Robert Lamb, Skinner’s methodological positions are best understood as methodology proper, not as a hermeneutic heuristic. Yet this may sound puzzling to social scientists and to historians of political thought, partly because Skinner seems little interested in developing or supporting explanations in ways they would find familiar. Covering laws, causal mechanisms, and theories of human psychology, to provide a few examples, are hard, if impossible to find in his works. Instead, he focuses on the meanings, intentions, goals, and rhetorical moves of particular individuals or small discursive communities. Despite this, despite claims made by some of Skinners interlocutors that he advances a kind of art, and despite several criticisms of behaviouralism, positivism and other modes of social science, I argue that Bevier and Lamb make a very convincing assessment. Skinner has advanced a methodology of the social sciences. But because Skinner’s views are sometimes developed in contradistinction with approaches to social science, the point of departure in this paper lies assessing what kind of science Skinner averred (or reverted to). What I want to suggest is that Skinner relies on a form of logical or deductive positivism in his writing, though the content of which is rather unlike typical examples of such positivism in the social science, such as rational choice. This argument is significant for several reasons, firstly it draws attention to the variance within a group of methods sometimes labelled interpretivist, and calls into question the supposed opposition of these with positivist social science. Secondly, the argument shows that Skinner’s method may, ironically, be vulnerable to many of the criticisms of rational choice theory that interpretivists, such as Iain Hampsher-Monk and Andrew Hindmoor have recently advanced.
