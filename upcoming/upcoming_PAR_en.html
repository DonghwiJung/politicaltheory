				<h2 class="text-justify">Positional Arms Races</h2>
			</div>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Positional goods are that which confer relative advantage. These include the quality of one’s high school grades, the trendiness of one’s clothing, and the protection afforded by one’s car in the event of a collision with another car, Competition for
				such goods often leads to ‘arms races’ – patterns of steadily escalating competition in which the participants’ efforts cancel each other out. This creates a problem of unequal distribution and social waste. Accordingly, positional goods are of much
				interest both to political philosophers and social scientists. Unfortunately, both disciplinary perspectives privilege some aspects of the subject matter while overlooking others. Philosophical approaches tend to ignore the diachronic nature of positional
				competition in favour of a ‘snapshot’ view. Social scientists are more attuned to how positional arms races worsen over time, but are reluctant to deploy the normative concepts necessary to gain a satisfactory account of what sort of problem we’re
				dealing with. In addition, both disciplines have been generally insensitive to the way in which different positional goods generate different sorts of arms races.
			<br />
				In this talk, I will attempt to sketch a more comprehensive account of the problem posed
				by positional arms races, drawing on both disciplinary perspectives, but with a view to taking seriously the hetereogeneous nature of positional competition.
